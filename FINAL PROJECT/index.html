          <h4>Chichén Itzá</h4>
          <p>
            Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico,
            which flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan
            tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of
            important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable
            is the stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79
            feet (24 meters) above the Main Plaza.

          <h4>Macchu Picchu</h4>
          <p>
            This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram
            Bingham, who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold
            used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule.
            Although that claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu
            has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the
            “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of
            chastity. Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage site, while
            some believe it was a royal retreat.

          <h4>Colloseum</h4>
          <p>
            The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the
            Emperor Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures
            620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of
            vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a
            variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights,
            though men battling animals was also common.

          <h4>Petra Jordan</h4>
          <p>
            The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley,
            nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be
            one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth.
            Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and
            during this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center,
            especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled
            dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone, which changed
            color with the shifting sun.

          <h4>The Great Wall of China</h4>
          <p>
            One of the world’s largest building-construction projects, the Great
            Wall of China is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km)
            long; a disputed Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170
            miles (21,200 km). <a href="explore.html">Learn More...</a>

          <h4>Christ The Redeemer</h4>
          <p>
            Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount
            Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World
            War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.”

          <h4>Taj Mahal</h4>
          <p>
            This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the
            world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of
            Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned
            1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the
            Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child.
